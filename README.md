- 👋 Hi, I’m Jasmine Erina Firdaus
- 👀 I’m interested in Back End Engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Front-End using Next.Js!

I have interest in Golang, JavaScript and database such as PHP, SQLite, and MySQL. I have been experiencing making backend application for social media base using Ruby on Rails. I’m a person who loves to learn and try something new to improve my skills and have passion in working together as a team.
